				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<p>
					Christ College of Engineering (CCE), established in 2015, is
					affiliated to APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University,
					Thiruvananthapuram; and is recognized by AICTE, New Delhi.
					This college was found at a time when starting a new
					engineering college was not considered as a sensible
					proposition. In its short span of existence, exceeding all
					expectations and proving all critics wrong, Christ College
					of Engineering has managed to create ripples on the academic
					front in the university, so much so that today the college
					is being recognized as one of the best self-financing
					engineering colleges in Kerala. Staff and students are at
					the center of this success story. No stone is being left
					unturned in ensuring that along with academics, the students
					get the right amount of exposure required for tomorrow’s
					successful global citizen, through the various initiatives
					held at this campus. With the kind of transformative
					learning model in place here, the college is well on its way
					to making a positive impact on our society and nation at
					large.
